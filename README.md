# Community
Welcome to our community! This is the perfect place to ask us questions, report issues and share feature ideas with us. In return, we promise to make the Props Remote Control app (even) better :)

## Install
Today, the app is released in a controlled environment. Once published, you will be able to purchase and download the Props Remote Control in the Apple and Google app stores.

Watch this space to stay informed about the release dates and early access opportunities! Send us a message if you want to be part of our testing group.

## Features
The app integrates seamlessly in the multi-user SetOps environment. All the prop scenarios are synced between all the devices and users of the production.

The app builds on a character <> phone <> scene structure. A phone will recognise it's character, and a scene can have an unlimited amount of actions on a phone.

### Mobile Phone interfaces
Common mobile phone interfaces such as lock screen, home screen and contact details come ready-first, customisable second. At any time, you can tweak the details you like, but starting on-the-fly has you covered too.

### Notifications
At any time in the flow of the scene notifications can be displayed, either timed or by direct command of the prop master. All the details are customisable, but if the available character data is sparse, the notification knows how to work with less as well.

### Calling
The meat and gravy of the app are the wide range of "calling" scenarios. No matter if the call comes in, goes out, is missed or hung up, the app has you covered. With direct remote control, or timed if that fits the need of the moment.

### Special Cases
It's only in the movies that a mobile phone runs out of battery, loses connection or reboot so often. That's exactly why we have elegant interfaces and animations to tackle these seamlessly with the other interactions.

### Customisation
The Props Remote Control app is focussed on keeping scenario building simple. No unwieldy configuration menus or endless spreadsheet lists.

Our simple-first approach works great for most cases, but we haven't forgotten about storylines that demand more. Since the app is built by props designers, we figured out how to switch between customised GFX screens and our app, directly on the mobile phone.

This powerful feature is good news for all designers in the art department.
